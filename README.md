#Personalized Restaurant Recommendation System

Imagine that you just land on a new city and you want to find the best restaurants around at your preference? This system is built for you :-) </br>

The frontend was done by HTML, CSS and Javascript. AJAX was used to communicate with the backend. </br>
The front end codes are in /WebContent</br>
</br>
The backend is composed of three java servlets that allows the user to explore, visit and get recommended restaurants. </br>
The backedn codes are in /src </br>
For the backend, we used MySQL to store three tables: 1. user table 2. restaurant table 3. the visiting history. Table 1 and 3 are related by the user id, table 2 and 3 are related by the restaurant business id </br>
</br>
For the recommendation algoriths, we used item based collabarative filtering
